I tried everything to add this notebook to watson studio but despite my best efforts was not able to add this notebook I was met with the following error message:

"Monthly compute usage limit reached You consumed all the compute usage, measured in capacity unit hours (CUH), that your Watson Studio lite-v1 plan allows for this month. Ask the project owner, latosha, to upgrade Watson Studio. If you are the owner, upgrade your plan.
